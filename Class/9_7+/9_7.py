#Object-Orientated Programming (OOP) is programming where we orientate our brains to think about objects
# x = []
# x is an instance of a list(class)
#list attrivutes - variable ov method
# .append() , .pop() , .remove() , .len -> number of items {all of these are encapsulation
#x = Car(max_speed = 50, make = "Toyota", ...)
