# the is keyword command checks to see if two objects are actually the same object

#can check type of string with type(obj)
# Lists are accesible for the items can call L[-2] for items second to last
#Tuples are ordered sequences of objects but are immutable
#dictionaries are key-value pairs
#Sets are collections of objects without duplicates; Serts and dictionaries are nonsequential collections; {} is an empty dictionary, an empyty set is set()
# can slice over a collect say print(a[3:7]) or print a[1:-2] or print(c[:2])
print b[1:] prints every element after first
# dictionary iterating is...
